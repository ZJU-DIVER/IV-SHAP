# Experimental Scripts Documentation

This README provides an overview of various scripts used in different experiments. Each script is tailored for a specific dataset or experiment.

## Scripts Overview

### 1. Synthetic.py
- **Description**: This script is used for experiments on the synthetic dataset.
- **Purpose**: It corresponds to the first experiment conducted on the synthetic data.

### 2. Griliches.py
- **Description**: This script is designed for experiments on the real dataset, griliches76.
- **Purpose**: It facilitates the experimentations and analysis on the griliches76 dataset.

### 3. Angrist.py
- **Description**: This script is used for conducting experiments on the real dataset Angrist.
- **Purpose**: It is tailored for specific experimental procedures on the Angrist dataset.

### 4. Approximation_Spam.py
- **Description**: This script is associated with the efficiency comparison experiment of SHAP.
- **Purpose**: It is used to compare the efficiency of SHAP approximations in different scenarios.

### 5. DNNClassifier_Synthetic.py
- **Description**: Corresponds to the experiments in the appendix involving discrete data.
- **Purpose**: This script is specifically used for experiments mentioned in the appendix of the study, focusing on discrete data analysis.

### 6. XGBRegressor_Synthetic.py
- **Description**: This script is utilized for experiments involving non-neural network models as mentioned in the appendix.
- **Purpose**: It is designed to facilitate experiments with models like XGBoost Regressor on synthetic datasets as part of extended studies in the appendix.
